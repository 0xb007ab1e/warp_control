### Task 1: Set up continuous integration using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
**Description:**  
- Set up a CI pipeline using either GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to automate builds and tests.  
**Required Tests:**  
- Verify CI pipeline runs on push and pull requests  
- Test pipeline with simple shell script to ensure it works  
**Abstractions:**  
- Use GitHub Actions or GitLab CI YAML configurations  
**Other Details:**  
- Choose GitHub Actions for simpler integration with GitHub repos  
**Dependencies:**  
- [ ] None (this is the first task)  
**Deadline:**  
- 2025-03-12  
**Owner:**  
- 0xb007ab1e  
**Status:**  
- Planned  
**Estimated Effort:**  
- 2 days  
**Resources Needed:**  
- GitHub Actions/GitLab CI documentation, test shell script  
**Risk Assessment:**  
- Risk: Integration issues with existing scripts. Mitigation: Test pipeline with a simple script first.

# Project Tracking: Linux Shell Script Package with TDD

## Prioritization and Tracking Rules

### Priority Rules
- Always work on the highest priority item that is blocking progress
- Foundational tasks (e.g., CI/CD setup, basic testing) take precedence over feature development
- Tasks that unblock or enable other tasks should be prioritized
- Tasks with dependencies should be ordered to resolve dependencies first
- Critical bug fixes or urgent issues take precedence over all other tasks

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD) Rules:**
    - Tests must be written and validated before any implementation code is written.
    - When generating new code, modifying existing code, or suggesting future updates, tests and TDD are the highest priority.
    - All code changes must include corresponding tests to validate functionality.
    - Tests must cover edge cases, failure scenarios, and expected behavior before implementation begins.
    - Code reviews must verify that tests are written and pass before implementation code is merged.

### Tracking Rules
- Each task must include a clear description, required tests, abstractions, and other relevant details
- The last action taken on a task must be recorded in the task's description
- Tasks must be updated regularly to reflect their current status
- Tasks that are completed or blocked must be clearly marked as such
